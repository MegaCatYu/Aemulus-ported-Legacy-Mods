# Aemulus-ported-Legacy-Mods
This is a repository for mods that have been reformatted to work with Aemulus.

To use one of the mods here, download it and drag it onto your Aemulus window.

To contribute, make a pr adding a .7z file of a mod converted to work with Aemulus. To convert mods to Aemulus format, see this tutorial: https://gamebanana.com/tuts/14862

Notice: 
If you have created one of the mods on here and would like it to be taken down, contact me at MegaCatYu#4608 at discord.gg/naoto.
I'm extremely new to using Github repositories, so I apologize in advance for anything that looks unusual.
